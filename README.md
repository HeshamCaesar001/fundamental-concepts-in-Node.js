# 🟢 Node.js Fundamentals Repository

This repository contains examples and exercises to help understand fundamental concepts in Node.js, including:

- 🛠️ CLI programming
- 🗂️ File system access
- 🔄 Asynchrony
- 🌊 Streams
- 🌐 HTTP servers & routing
- 🗄️ Database persistence
- 🧑‍💻 Child processes

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each file in this repository demonstrates one or more of the above concepts. To run a file, use the shbang command. For example, to run `ex2.js`, you can type:

```bash
./ex2.js
```

To get a list of available commands and usage instructions for each file, you can run the file with the `--help` option:

```bash
./filename.js --help
```
