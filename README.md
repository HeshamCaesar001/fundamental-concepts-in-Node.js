# Node.js Fundamentals Repository

This repository contains examples and exercises to help understand fundamental concepts in Node.js, including:

- CLI programming
- File system access
- Asynchrony
- Streams
- HTTP servers & routing
- Database persistence
- Child processes

## Getting Started

Each file in this repository demonstrates one or more of the above concepts. To run a file, use the shbang command. For example, to run `ex2.js`, you can type:

```bash
./ex2.js
```

To get a list of available commands and usage instructions for each file, you can run the file with the `--help` option:

```bash
./filename.js --help
```

## File Descriptions

- **ex1.js**: Introduction to CLI programming in Node.js.
- **ex2.js**: Demonstrates file system access.
- **ex3.js**: Covers asynchronous programming in Node.js.
- **ex4.js**: Example of using streams in Node.js.
- **ex5.js**: Demonstrates setting up an HTTP server and routing.
- **ex6.js**: Example of database persistence with Node.js.
- **ex7.js**: Introduction to child processes in Node.js.
- **ex7-child.js**: Supplementary file for `ex7.js`.
- **local-cmd.js**: Local command example.
- **mydb.sql**: SQL file for database setup.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Running the Examples

Navigate to the directory containing the files and run any example as shown below:

```bash
cd path/to/your/repo
./ex1.js
```

Use the `--help` option with any file to understand its usage:

```bash
./ex1.js --help
```
